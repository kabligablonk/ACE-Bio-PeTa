# ACE + Biology Performance Task

This ACE and Biology performance task aims to make understanding the nerve cell easy to take in and understand as possible. This is done through the use of a physical 3D model of the nerve cell and combining the power of a raspberry pi.

 

## Functionality
This project makes use of a raspberry pi, buttons, and LEDs to work synchronously to provide information given the selected part.

For example, index 0 in the dictionary is about the *axon* of the nerve cell. Pressing the increment button increments this index by 1 and decrements 1 using the decrement button. Getting the information about this specific part will be printed after pressing the submit button.

Now at index 1, pressing the submit button does two functions. First, it returns the information about the specific part. Second, it send a signal to the LED at the portion of the 3D model where it is located to be lit up.
